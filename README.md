# What is Solari?
Soalri is my attempt at building an artificial intelligence application that is similar to Amazon's Alexa and Google Home.  Originally, the build used AIML to talk with the user, but over time AIML became cumbersome.   Solari is a RESTful API engine that allows one to ask it questions and to get a response returned in json format.  This can then be fed through the text-to-spech API to allow an application to speak to the user.

I have built the application to utilize modules to pull information from various third parties.  This allows Solari to be  extremely flexible in the services it can provide.   

I am also looking for coders to help me build this application.  I am not the best developer, but this base is stable enough to where we as a community can build upon it :)

# How do I install Solari?
Vist the wiki at https://github.com/magikfoxzero/solari/wiki to learn how to install Solari.

# How can I help?
Simple.  Help build the modules that are in the api/src/skills folder.  I have built a few simple ones to search wikipedia, NPR, pull weather, and more.

Anyone who wants to build a client to work with the service would be greatly appreciated as well.   Bonus points to whoever can implement a client that uses the wake word Solari (pronounced So-Lar-ee).

And finally, any fine tuning and optimization to the api engine that the application could benefit from is also welcome.
